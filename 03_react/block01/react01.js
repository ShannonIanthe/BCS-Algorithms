Exercise 2

    Create 2 react components, one of them will be the parent component and the other will be the child component, 
    the parent component will render the child component passing a prop to it (this will be your name that you first assign to the parent component using the keyword this) 
    the child component needs to return the following message: Hello 'the name you passed as a prop' i am a child component!

Exercise 6 extra challenge

    create a div which contains 2 inputs and one button.
    each of these should be a separate components, all rendered by a parent component called App.
    you should collect the data from the inputs and make it available in the parent component (using a function would work for this).
    input 1 should collect the data  for the firstname
    and input 2 should collect the data for the lastname.
    to make thigs easier you may use refs in the input fileds.
    when the button (also a separate component) is clicked then you should alert the data collectd by the two inputs.
