## Exercise 1

    Write a class based component, with an input that takes the data from the user, the data is then displayed (rendered) as an h1 in the page, 
    if no text is provided it should display a text saying "no text provided!" (You should use the onChange event ) 

## Exercise 2

   Remake the previous exercise, this time using a functional component and the useState Hook.


## Exercise 3

    In a functional component , create a div which contains 2 inputs and one button.
    each of these should be a separate component, all rendered by a parent component called App.
    you should collect the data from the inputs and make it available in the parent component (using a function would work for this).
    input 1 should collect the data for the email.
    and input 2 should collect the data for the password.
    when the button (also a separate component) is clicked then you should alert the data collected by the two inputs.
    (You should use the onChange and onClick events )
