// Please write your solution in the corresponding folder/file to make them available for the testing

//IN ORDER TO TEST YOUR SOLUTIONS YOU SHOULD RUN THE FOLLOWING COMAND IN THE TERMINAL
//npm run test-single -- test/'NAME_OF_THE_TEST_FILE_YOU_ARE_TESTING'

example :
if you are doing exercise 1 of block 1 it should be 

//npm run test-single -- test/b1exercise1.test.js

EXERCISE 1:

//create a variable called apple and assign to it a value of 5
//then create another variable called apple2 and give to it a value of 15.
//and finally sum the together and return their sum.







EXERCISE 2:

//create 2 variables:
//a , b
//assign 10 to a and 24 to b

//return the total of the multiplication of a and b








EXERCISE 3:

//Age calculator

//Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!

//Store your birth year in a variable.

//Store a future year in a variable.


//Output the age!








EXERCISE 4:

//Ever wondered how much a "lifetime supply of Tea you will need?"
//let's find out!!!
//store  your current age in a variable
//store your estimated end age in a variable
//store how many teas you drink per day on average
//calculate how many you will need until the end!

//Output the result!

// DO NOT USE THE TESTING PLATFORM FOR THE EXERCISES 5,6,7

EXERCISE 5:

//Declare the following variables with the following values:

//a => 10
//b => 22

//c => 43
//d => 54

//e => 65
//f => 34

//
//g => 10
//h => 10

//then compare them in pairs using the JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
//https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp
//and make sure that the result of your comparison is the following:
//false, false, true, true


//example

//console.log(10 > 5) 
//this will return true

//compare  (a,b) (c,d), (e,f), (g,h)



//should console.log false, false, true, true








EXERCISE 6:

//using 'strict equality' check, compare the following variables and console.log true if the are NOT the same and false if they are


//num  =>  10 
//num1 => "10"

//num2 =>  33 
//num3 =>  44 

//num4 =>  21 
//num5 =>  21 

//num6 =>  0  
//num7 =>  0 









EXERCISE 7:

//tell which number is even
//assign each of the below number to a variable, then using the module operator check which of them is even and which is odd, and return true if is even and false if is odd

//3,  123 , 545 , 34 , 64 , 6634 , 876








EXERCISE 8:

//knowing that the minimum age for driving a 50cc scooter is 15 define a variable called age
// and then return true if you are old enough to drive a scooter and false if you are not








EXERCISE 9:

//define the name of the user
//define the year of birth of the user
//return his name and current age in a sentence like in the example:
// ******EXAMPLE******
//Hello Jason, you are 34 years old









EXERCISE 10:

//define the user year of birth
//assign the current year to a variable.
//then return the following message, replacing the word *'DAYS'* with the actual value

// you have lived for *'DAYS'* days already!








EXERCISE 11:

//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here:
http://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output the result.
// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output the result.
