// Create a function called checker that loops through a string and checks how 
// many occurrences of commas and question marks there are in it.
// it then returns a string with the numbers of commas and question marks
// please make sure to use the appropriate form, so if for instance there are 
// more than one commas / question marks you should use plural 
// like commas / question marks, otherwise singular: comma / question mark.
