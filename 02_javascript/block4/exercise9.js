// create a function called uniqueElements which takes an array as argument.
// you need one array with the unique elements so loop through and get rid of duplicates.
// (also these who were double before removing the duplicates)
// you should return an array only with the unique elements, without duplicates
// the original array should be left untouched..


// extend the previous exercise by making sure to return only the unique elements 
// of the array only this time the function takes a second argument, max.
// all items of the newarray  must be numbers and bigger or equal than max. (no conversion to numbers)
